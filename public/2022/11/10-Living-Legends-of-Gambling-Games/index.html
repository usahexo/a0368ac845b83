<ol>
<li>You must have a vast knowledge of the game.</li>
</ol>
<p>To be a gambling legend, you need to have an extensive knowledge of the game you are playing. This means knowing all the different strategies and ways to win. You must also know when to fold and when to hold ‘em.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>You must have nerves of steel.</li>
</ol>
<p>Gambling can be a very nerve-wracking experience, especially if you are playing for high stakes. A living gambling legend must have nerves of steel and be able to handle the pressure of the game.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>You must be able to stay cool under pressure.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to having nerves of steel, you must also be able to stay calm under pressure. If you crack under pressure, it will be difficult to become a living gambling legend.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>You must have superb skills at math and logic.</li>
</ol>
<p>Math and logic skills are essential for any gambler, but they are especially important for those looking to become living gambling legends. These skills will help you figure out the odds of each hand and make sound decisions accordingly.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>You must be able to control your emotions.</li>
</ol>
<p> emotion can often lead to poor decision-making in gambling games. A living gambling legend must be able to keep their emotions in check so that they can make rational decisions at all times.</p>
