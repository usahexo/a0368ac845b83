#  Knicks Officially Tank in Win Against Pacers

The New York Knicks have begun their tanking process.

They started by losing to the Indiana Pacers, 108-101. While the final score may not reflect it, it was a blowout for most of the game.

It was an ugly performance all around for the Knicks. They turned the ball over 20 times and only shot 37 percent from the field.

Their only saving grace was that they outscored the Pacers in bench points, 54-32. Emmanuel Mudiay led the way with 22 points off the bench.

The Knicks front office has made it clear that they are focused on rebuilding. This means that they are going to lose as many games as possible over the next few months.

This will allow them to draft a high-level player in next year's draft. The goal is to put themselves in a position to compete for championships in the near future.

Some Knicks fans may not be happy with this strategy, but it is ultimately what is best for the team. They have been stuck in mediocrity for far too long and need to make a drastic change.

This tanking process may be painful in the short term, but it will pay off in the long run.

#  NBA Investigates Knicks for Allegedly tanking game to improve draft lottery odds

The NBA announced on Tuesday that it has opened an investigation into the New York Knicks for allegedly tanking a game against the Philadelphia 76ers last month in order to improve their draft lottery odds.

“The integrity of the game is of paramount importance to the NBA, and we will continue to work with our partners to ensure that games are conducted fairly at all times,” league spokesman Mike Bass said in a statement.

In a statement released Tuesday afternoon, the Knicks denied any wrongdoing.

“We are confident that there was no tampering with the game ball,” team spokesman Jonathan Supranowitz said.

The league began investigating after a report from Philadelphia sports talk radio station WIP-FM alleged that Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek had ordered his players to lose Sunday’s game against the 76ers. The report cited an anonymous source “close to the situation.”

Hornacek denied those allegations after Tuesday’s shootaround.

“I don’t know who that would be, but that’s not true,” he said. “Whoever said that is not knowledgeable about what goes on in our locker room.”

The Knicks (24-37) entered Tuesday night’s game against the Detroit Pistons 11th in the Eastern Conference, and they have little chance of making the playoffs. The 76ers (25-36) were two games behind the Knicks in 12th place.

#  Hornacek Denies Tank Job After 118-107 Victory Over Pacers

It was a much-needed victory for the New York Knicks.

In a 118-107 win over the Indiana Pacers, Jeff Hornacek denied any rumors of his team tanking the season.

"I don't think that's ever been in our minds," Hornacek said postgame. "We're trying to play hard every night and get wins."

David Lee led the way with 19 points and 10 rebounds off the bench in his first game back since being traded from Dallas. Carmelo Anthony chipped in 18 points, nine rebounds and six assists. Derrick Rose also added 18 points.

The Knicks (24-36) have now won two straight games and four of their last six.

"It's good to finally get a win after all the trade talk and everything that's been going on," Hornacek said. "Guys are still playing hard."

The Pacers (34-25) had their five-game winning streak snapped. Paul George led all scorers with 27 points, while Myles Turner added 20 points and 11 rebounds. Jeff Teague chipped in 16 points and eight assists off the bench.

#  Porzingis: We're Not Tanking

It was a disappointing season for the New York Knicks. But don't tell that to Kristaps Porzingis.

Hours after the Knicks were officially eliminated from playoff contention, Porzingis emphatically shot down any notions of tanking.

"We're not tanking," Porzingis said. "We're going to play these last games and compete."

Porzingis is right to be defiant. The Knicks may be out of the playoffs, but they still have plenty to play for.

First and foremost, the Knicks need to improve their draft position. They currently sit in 10th place in the Eastern Conference, and they have a good chance of landing a Top 5 pick in this year's draft.

But the Knicks also need to build some momentum heading into next season. There's still plenty of talent on this team, and if they can show some progress in the second half of this season, it will give them something to build on next year.

So while the playoffs may be out of reach, the Knicks still have plenty to play for over the next few weeks.

#  Knicks end three game losing streak with 118-107 victory over Pacers

The New York Knicks were in desperate need of a win, and they got it on Sunday night against the Indiana Pacers.

With the score tied at 105 with just over two minutes to play, the Knicks went on an 11-2 run to close out the game and pick up their first victory in over a week.

"We needed that one," said Tim Hardaway Jr., who led the Knicks with 23 points. "We've been in a little slump lately, so it was good to finally get a win."

Kristaps Porzingis added 21 points and nine rebounds for New York, while Enes Kanter chipped in 20 points and 14 rebounds.

The Knicks had fallen to 7-10 on the season with consecutive losses to the Denver Nuggets, Miami Heat, and Milwaukee Bucks.

They will attempt to build off of this victory when they take on the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday night.
