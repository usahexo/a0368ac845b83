#  How to Count Poker Hands with Spades 

When playing poker, one of the most important decisions you'll make is how to value your hand. The value of a hand will determine how much you should bet, and whether or not it's worth calling or folding.

There are a lot of ways to count poker hands, but in this article we'll focus specifically on counting hands with spades.

First, we'll need to define what we mean by a "hand". In poker, a hand is made up of five cards. The rank of each card determines the hand's value. The higher the rank of the card, the better the hand.

Here's a ranked list of all 52 possible hands in poker:

Royal flush 
Straight flush 
Four of a kind 
Full house 
Flush 
 Straight 
Three of a kind 
Two pairs 
One pair 
High card


A royal flush is the best possible hand in poker, and it's made up of five consecutive cards from 10 to Ace (all of the same suit). A straight flush is next best, and it's made up of five consecutive cards in any suit. After that comes four of a kind, full house, flush, straight, three of a kind, two pairs and one pair. Finally, the highest-ranking card in your hand (the "high card") determines the overall ranking of your hand.
The rank of each card is as follows: Aces are high; 2s through 9s are low. Jokers are not used in poker. So for example, 8-7-6-5-4 would be ranked as two pairs (8s and 4s), since 7-6-5-4-3 would be ranked as three of a kind (7s).
Now that we know how to rank hands, let's learn how to count them using spades! We'll start by counting the number of ways we can make different types of hands. There are 13 different types of spade hands:

One spade – there is only one way to make this particular hand (with one spade).  Two spades – there are two ways to make this particular hand (with two spades). Three spades – there are three ways to make this particular hand (with three spades). Four spades – there are four ways to make this particular hand (with four spades). Five spades – there are five ways to make this particular hand (with five spades). Six spades – there are six ways to make this particular hand (with six spades). One high club – there are twelve ways to make this particular hand (one way with an Ace + eleven ways with any other club). Two high clubs – there are twenty-four ways to make this particular hand (two ways with an Ace + twenty-two ways with any other club). Three high clubs -there are thirty-six waysto make this particular hand(three way with an Ace+thirty threeways with any otherclub) Four high clubs -thereare forty -eight waysto makethisparticularhand(fourwayath Ace+forty fourwaysith any otherclub) Five high clubs -thereare sixty -zero waystomake thisthatpicularhand(fiveway ath Ace+fifty ninewaysith any otherclub) Six high clubs -therpainlessonel hundredtwelve waystomakethisparticularhand(sixway ath Ace+one hundred sixwaysith any ot

#  All In: Five Card Stud With Spades 

Starting with the most important thing, let’s just get this out of the way—Five Card Stud is a great game. Period. If you enjoy playing poker, and haven’t given it a try, you really should. It’s straightforward and simple enough for beginners, but has enough depth and strategy to keep experienced players engaged.

One big bonus: it’s perfect for small groups or even just two people. So if you’re looking for an enjoyable game to play while socializing with friends, Five Card Stud is a great option.

Now that we’ve got that out of the way, let’s move on to the specifics of the game. In Five Card Stud, there are usually five or six players at a table. The aim is to end up with the best five-card poker hand at the end of the game. 

The basic rules are pretty simple: each player is dealt five cards, face down. The player with the strongest hand (based on traditional poker rankings) begins the betting round. From there, each player in turn either places a bet (or folds), or draws one card from the deck and replaces one of their cards face down (this is called ‘drawing dead’ if it doesn’t improve their hand). The winner is determined by who has the best poker hand at the showdown, and the pot is awarded accordingly. 

The only other thing you need to know before starting your first game is which suits are wildcards. In Five Card Stud, spades are always wild. This can add an extra layer of strategy to the game, as you need to take into account what cards your opponents may be holding wildcards too. 

So now you know all there is to know about Five Card Stud! Get yourself some friends together, find a table and get started!

#  Find the probability of a 5 card poker hand containing all spades 

The probability of a hand containing all spades is 4/52, or 1/13. This calculation can be done by multiplying the individual probabilities of each card: (1/4) x (3/51) x (4/50) x (5/49) = 1/13.

#  How to Calculate Probability When Playing Five Card Poker With Spades

In five card poker with spades, the probability of getting a flush (all five cards of the same suit) is 8.69%. This means that if you were to play 100 hands of poker, you would expect to get a flush 8.7 times.

To calculate the probability of getting a flush when playing five card poker with spades, we need to use two different formulas: the combination formula and the permutation formula.

The combination formula is: C(n,k) = n!/(k!(n-k)!)

The permutation formula is: n!/(k!(n-k)!).

In our example, n=5 and k=4. So, the combination formula would be: 5!/(4!(5-4)!). And the permutation formula would be: 5!/(4!(1)).

Plugging these numbers into each equation gives us: 120/6 and 120/120. So, the probability of getting a flush in five card poker with spades is 8.69%.
