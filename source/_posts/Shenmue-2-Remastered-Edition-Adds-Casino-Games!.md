#  Advanced Gambling Menu Now Available In Remastered Shenmue 2!

Shenmue 2 has been remastered and released on current gen platforms! The game looks and runs great, but what fans are really excited about is the all new advanced gambling menu.

The old casino only had blackjack, slot machines and a roulette wheel. The new casino features Texas hold'em poker, three card poker, and a craps table. These new games add a lot of depth to the gambling experience, and provide a much needed challenge for veteran players.

Texas hold'em is the most popular variant of poker. It's played with two cards in hand and five community cards that are placed face up on the table. Players can use any combination of their two cards and the five community cards to create the best possible hand.

Three card poker is also popular, and is similar to Texas hold'em except that players are only dealt three cards instead of two. This makes it a little easier to form good hands, but the odds are still against you.

Craps is the most complex game in the casino, but it's also the most fun. There are dozens of different betting options available, so it can be a little daunting for newcomers. But with a little practice, you can learn how to play like a pro!

Whether you're a seasoned gambler or just looking for something new to try, the advanced gambling menu in Shenmue 2 Remastered is sure to please. So get out there and start racking up those winnings!
