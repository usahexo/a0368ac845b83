#  NY to Get its Own Sports Betting Site as Part of a Deal Reached with 8 States

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Monday that the state had reached a deal with 8 other states to allow regulated sports betting. The agreement will allow New York to operate its own sports betting site, which is expected to go online in early 2019.

The eight states involved in the agreement are New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Michigan, Ohio, and Illinois. Cuomo said that the deal would allow the states to “pool resources and information” in order to better regulate and monitor sports betting.

The agreement comes as a number of states look to legalize sports betting in the wake of last month’s Supreme Court ruling that struck down a federal ban on the practice. While Nevada has long been allowed to offer sports betting, most other states have been waiting for a green light from the federal government.

Now that the ban has been lifted, a number of states are moving quickly to legalize sports betting. Rhode Island became the first state to do so after the Supreme Court ruling, and several others are expected to follow suit in the coming weeks and months.

Sports betting is expected to be a lucrative industry, with analysts predicting that it could generate up to $7 billion in annual revenue. That’s good news for cash-strapped states like New York, which stand to make significant profits from taxing sports bets.

Governor Cuomo hailed the agreement as a major victory for New York. “This is a great day for New Yorkers, who now have certainty that their State will offer legalized sports betting as soon as early next year,” he said in a statement. “I want to thank our partners in this effort – NJ Governor Murphy, DE Governor Carney, PA Governor Wolf, WV Governor Justice, MI Governor Snyder, OH Governor Kasich and IL Governor Rauner – for their hard work on this issue and their commitment to shared regulation across our States.”

#  You Can Now Bet on Sports in New York!

Back in May, governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, signed a bill that would allow sports betting in the state. Bettors have been patiently waiting for this moment and it is now official as the first bets have been placed!

The new law allows for mobile betting and there are already a few dozen establishments that have applied for licenses. The bill was passed with overwhelming support in both the senate and assembly and many believe that this could be a major windfall for the state.

There are some restrictions, however, as bets cannot be placed on collegiate games taking place in New York and bets on high school games are prohibited altogether. In addition, any bets placed on New York teams must involve at least two other teams.

One of the strongest selling points of sports betting is that it can create jobs. The industry is expected to generate hundreds of jobs in the state and bring in millions of dollars in tax revenue. This will help to offset some of the losses that the state has seen in recent years due to gambling expansion elsewhere.

So far, it seems that most people are happy with the new law. Of course, there are always some who oppose gambling but they are in the minority. The fact is that sports betting is already happening anyway, so it makes sense to allow it and regulate it instead of trying to prohibit it.

This is great news for bettors who reside in New York and it looks like there will be plenty of opportunities to place wagers on your favourite sports teams!

#  New York State Authorizes Online and Mobile Sports Betting

The New York State Gaming Commission has authorized online and mobile sports betting, effective immediately. This will make the state the second in the nation, behind New Jersey, to offer such gambling options.

“This is a major step forward in our efforts to legalize sports betting in New York,” said Gaming Commission chairman James Featherstonhaugh. “We believe that this new product will provide a valuable addition to the existing array of gaming options available in New York and generate new economic activity across the state.”

Preliminary estimates suggest that up to $100 million could be generated annually in tax revenue from sports betting in New York. The Gaming Commission also anticipates that this will create thousands of new jobs across the state.

Betting on sporting events has been taking place illegally in New York for many years, so it is expected that there will be some initial confusion among consumers regarding the new authorized offerings. The Gaming Commission plans to launch a comprehensive education campaign to ensure that people are aware of the new options and how to use them.

Plans call for both online and mobile sports betting to initially be offered through licensed casinos in upstate New York. These include del Lago Resort & Casino in Seneca County, Rivers Casino and Resort in Schenectady County, Montreign Resort Casino in Sullivan County, Tioga Downs Casino Resort in Tioga County, and Casino Niagara in Niagara Falls.Sports bets will also be able to be placed at off-track betting facilities throughout the state.

In addition to authorizing sports betting, the Gaming Commission also approved updates to regulations governing other forms of gaming including casino gambling, charitable gaming, and lottery products.

#  New York Becomes Latest State to Legalize Sports Gambling

On Tuesday, the New York State Assembly voted to legalize sports gambling in the state. The measure now goes to the desk of Governor Andrew Cuomo,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) who is expected to sign it into law. This makes New York the seventh state in the US to legalize sports gambling, following Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Mississippi.

The legalization of sports gambling in New York has been a long time coming. In 2013, the US Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on sports gambling. This left the decision up to each individual state. Since then, several states have moved to legalize it.

Supporters of legalized sports gambling argue that it will generate new revenue for the state government. They also say that it will create new jobs and stimulate the economy. Opponents argue that it will lead to more gambling addiction and other social problems.

How much revenue legalized sports gambling will generate is still unknown. However, it is estimated that the gaming industry in New York is worth $3 billion annually. It is also estimated that there are over two million people in New York who currently participate in some form of illegal sports betting. If just a fraction of these people switch to legal sports betting, it could generate significant revenue for the state government.

Legalized sports gambling is already underway in several states. In Nevada, for example, casinos have been offering legal sports betting since 1949. In Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, betting is available through online casinos and mobile apps. Sports gambling has also been legalized in Mississippi, but has not yet gone into effect.

It is still unclear how much revenue legalized sports gambling will generate nationwide. However, given that there are over 40 states that have either legalized it or are considering doing so, it is likely to be a multi-billion dollar industry.
