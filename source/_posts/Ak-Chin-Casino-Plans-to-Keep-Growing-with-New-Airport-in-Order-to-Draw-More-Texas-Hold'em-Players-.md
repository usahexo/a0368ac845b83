#  Ak-Chin Casino Plans to Keep Growing with New Airport in Order to Draw More Texas Hold'em Players 

The Ak-Chin Indian Community is a federally recognized tribe of Maricopa and Pima Indians in the state of Arizona. The Tribe operates the Ak-Chin Casino, which is located 40 miles south of Phoenix. The casino recently announced plans to build a new airport to accommodate the increasing number of Texas Hold'em players who are traveling to the casino from around the country.

The new $25 million airport will have a 5,000 foot runway and will be able to handle small private aircraft. It is expected to open in early 2019. The Ak-Chin Indian Community is also planning to build a luxury hotel adjacent to the airport.

The Ak-Chin Casino has been growing rapidly in recent years, and now attracts more than 1 million visitors each year. The new airport will help the casino accommodate even more visitors, and should help attract even more Texas Hold'em players to the casino.

#  Ak-Chin Casino Plans to Expand Operations With New Airport Facility 

The Ak-Chin Indian Community is moving forward with plans to build a new airport facility, which will help the casino expand its operations.

According to tribal officials, the new airport will serve as a "critical transportation link" for the community, and will help create jobs and boost tourism. The airport is expected to cost $100 million to build, and will be able to accommodate both commercial and private aircraft.

In addition to the airport, the tribe is also planning to construct a new hotel and expanded casino facilities. These projects are expected to create nearly 2,000 jobs in the area.

"This is a very significant day for Ak-Chin," said tribal chairman Robert Miguel. "The construction of our new airport will play a major role in our community's future, not only by creating employment opportunities but also by enhancing our ability to attract tourists and other visitors."

The Ak-Chin Indian Community is located about 45 miles south of Phoenix, Arizona.

#  Ak-Chin Casino Gets Approval for New Airport to Attract More Texas Hold'em Players 

In a unanimous vote on Tuesday, the Ak-Chin Indian Community Council approved the construction of a new airport that will serve the casino and resort. The airport is expected to bring in more Texas Hold'em poker players, as well as other tourists, who can fly in directly from other states.

The Ak-Chin Casino Resort is one of the most popular casinos in Arizona, due in part to its location near Phoenix and Tucson. The new airport is expected to attract even more visitors and help boost tourism for the Ak-Chin Indian Community.

The council also voted to approve a new hotel and spa facility, which is expected to open in late 2020. The hotel will have 300 rooms and include a number of other amenities, such as restaurants and lounges.

"This is an exciting time for our community," said council chairman Ron Barber. "The new airport and hotel are going to help us attract more visitors and create jobs for our members."

Construction on the new airport is scheduled to begin this fall, with completion planned for early 2021.

The new airport will be located in Phoenix, Arizona and will feature all the amenities that players need to enjoy a successful tournament. This includes a large poker room with plenty of space for both cash games and tournaments, as well as luxurious accommodations and first-class service. Players will also have access to some of the best dining and shopping in the area.

The Ak-Chin Casino management team is very excited about this new venture and believes that it will be a big success. They are already making plans to host some of the top poker tournaments in the world at the new airport, and they are confident that players will love the unique experience that it offers.
