#  Virgin Casino Offers Blackjack How To Tutorial

In this tutorial we're going to show you how to play blackjack at Virgin Casino. This casino offers some of the best blackjack games around with great odds for players.

The first thing you need to do is sign up for a Virgin Casino account. You can do this by clicking on the green "Sign Up" button on the homepage. Once you've registered, you'll be able to make a deposit and start playing.

Blackjack is a very simple game to learn but there are a few basic things you need to know before playing. The following tips will help you get started:

-Choose a table that suits your bankroll. The minimum bet at most blackjack tables is usually $5 but if you're just starting out, it's best to play at tables with lower minimums until you get used to the game.

-Learn the basic rules of blackjack. There are lots of different variations of the game but the basic rules are always the same. Make sure you understand them before playing.

-Know when to hit and when to stand. If your total is below 17, you should hit, and if your total is 17 or more, you should stand. You can also refer to the helpful chart below for other Blackjack hit and stand decision points:







 

 

 

  -If your first two cards total 8 or less, hit.-If your first two cards total 9 and the dealer has 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 showing, hit.-If your first two cards total 10 and the dealer has any card other than an ace showing, hit.-If your first two cards total 11 and the dealer has any card other than a 2 showing, hit.-If your first two cards equal 12-16 and the dealer has 2-6 showing, hit only if your card total is above 12.-If your first two cards equal 12-16 and the dealer has an ace showing, stand.--Always remember that double down conditions vary from casino to casino so be sure to read up on the specific rules at Virgin Casino before playing.

-Split pairs if possible. If you are dealt two cards of the same value (e.g., 2 kings), you can split them into two separate hands by placing another bet equal to the original bet. This gives you twice as many chances to win a hand. Note: Some casinos may only allow you to split pairs once so be sure to check with Virgin Casino before playing if splitting is important to you.

-Use insurance wisely. When the dealer has an ace showing, players can choose to purchase insurance in case he gets a blackjack (a hand containing an ace and 10). This costs half of your original bet and pays off 2:1 if the dealer does indeed have a blackjack. Most experts agree that it's not usually worth purchasing insurance as there's only a slight chance of winning but it's up to each player whether they want to take this option or not.

Now that you know some basic tips, let's walk through an example hand so you can see how everything works:

You've just registered for an account at Virgin Casino and deposited $100 so you can start playing blackjack (the minimum bet at most tables is $5). You sit down at a table that has a $10 minimum buy-in and start dealing yourself some cards...

Your opening hand is: Ace of Spades, 4 of Hearts 

 So what do these numbers mean? In blackjack, all counting cards are worth their face value with one exception: Aces are either 1 or 11 depending on what makes sense for busting (we'll get more into this later). In our example hand above, we have an Ace which counts as 11 (since it would push us over 21 if we took another card) and a 4 which counts as 4 points in total (2 + 2). Our running total therefore becomes 15 points (11 + 4).Take note that in some cases dealers will request that players place their bets in increments of $5 instead of $10 so be sure to ask what denomination Virgin Casino uses before betting! Now let's see what happens next...

Dealer draws card number 7 giving themselves 18 

 At this point in time, our opponent now has 18 points which means they're very close to busting unless they get another high card soon! We currently have 15 points in our running tally so we need either an Ace or any other 10 point card OR TWO MORE CARDS worth 5 points OR MORE in order not bust ourselves.. Dealer takes another card giving themselves 19 

The dealer draw activates our Insurance bet which costs us half of our initial wager ($50) but would pay out $100 if it resulted in a dealers BlackJack combination .. Dealer takes their last card meaning they finish with 20 

Since we were holding an Ace previously in our initial hand

#  Choose the Best Blackjack Game at Virgin Casino

Virgin Casino offers a wide variety of blackjack games, but how do you choose the best one for you? This guide will help you determine which game is right for you and get you gaming in no time!

## Classic Blackjack

Classic blackjack is the original game of blackjack. It’s simple to play and perfect for beginners. The object of the game is to beat the dealer by either getting closer to 21 than the dealer without going over, or by forcing the dealer to bust. You can play classic blackjack with up to three hands at once, giving you more chances to win!

## Vegas Strip Blackjack

If you’re looking for a more challenging game, Vegas Strip blackjack is perfect for you. The rules are slightly different than classic blackjack, making it more difficult to win but also increasing your potential rewards. In Vegas Strip blackjack, players can only bet one hand at a time, but there are multiple betting options available. This game is perfect for experienced players who want a little more excitement from their blackjack games!

## Spanish Blackjack

Spanish blackjack is similar to classic blackjack, but features some added bonuses that can give you an edge over the dealer. In Spanish blackjack, players are given two cards and can then choose to either hit or stand. If you decide to hit and draw another card that makes your total score over 21 (a bust), you lose automatically—even if the dealer busts as well. This adds an extra layer of strategy to the game and can make things a bit more exciting!

The aim of the game is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible without going bust. In classic blackjack, players can only split pairs once, but Atlantic City and Vegas Strip variants offer more flexibility in this respect. In addition, Double Exposure allows players to see both dealer cards at the start of the game.

When it comes to betting, there are a number of options available. You can bet as little as $0.10 per hand or go all in with a bet of $200 per hand. The minimum and maximum bets vary from game to game so be sure to check the table before placing your bets.
