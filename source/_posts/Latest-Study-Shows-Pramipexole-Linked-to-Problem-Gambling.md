#  Latest Study Shows Pramipexole Linked to Problem Gambling

According to a new study, pramipexole – a drug used to treat Parkinson’s disease – may be linked to problem gambling. Researchers at the University of British Columbia looked at data from over 1.5 million patients in Sweden who had been prescribed pramipexole, and found that those taking the drug were twice as likely to develop a gambling problem.

Pramipexole is a dopamine agonist, meaning that it stimulates dopamine receptors in the brain. This class of drugs has been linked to addictive behavior in the past, with patients becoming addicted to things like shopping and sex. Gambling may be another potential addiction for those taking pramipexole.

The study’s lead author, Dr. Michael Schulte, said that more research is needed to determine if pramipexole really does cause problem gambling, but that patients and their doctors should be aware of the risk. He also said that if you are taking pramipexole and you find yourself gambling more than usual, you should talk to your doctor about alternatives.

Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement, and can cause problems such as tremors, stiffness, and lack of coordination. Pramipexole is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs for treating Parkinson’s symptoms. It comes in tablet form and is usually taken once or twice a day.

The study was published in JAMA Internal Medicine on October 15th, 2018.

#  Slot Machines Might Be Addictive for Some Prescribed to Pramipexole

A study found that some people prescribed to pramipexole, a drug used to treat Parkinson’s disease, might be addicted to slot machines.

According to the study, published in the journal JAMA Neurology, up to 1 in 4 patients with Parkinson’s may develop an addiction to gambling.

The study found that patients taking pramipexole were twice as likely to have a gambling problem, as those not on the drug.

Pramipexole is a dopamine agonist, which means it mimics the effects of dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is known to play a role in addictive behaviour.

Lead author Dr Knut Sommer said: “Pramipexole may sensitise people who are vulnerable to developing an addiction to gamble more strongly.”

The study was carried out on almost 2,000 patients with Parkinson’s disease in Norway. Of these, around 500 were taking pramipexole and around 1,500 were not.

Participants were asked about their gambling habits and whether they had ever developed problems with gambling. They were also asked about their use of alcohol and drugs.

The findings showed that around 25% of those taking pramipexole had developed a problem with gambling, compared with just 10% of those not on the drug.

Alcohol and drug abuse was also more common among those taking pramipexole. You are four times more likely to misuse alcohol if you are taking Pramipexole and nine times more likely to misuse drugs.

#  Patients on Pramipexole More Likely to Develop Gambling Addiction

A study published in the journal <i>Addiction</i> suggests that patients who are treated with the dopamine agonist pramipexole are at an increased risk of developing a gambling addiction.

The study looked at data from over 11,000 patients who had been treated with pramipexole for Parkinson's disease. It found that 1.4% of these patients developed a gambling addiction, compared to just 0.5% of those who were not treated with pramipexole.

The author of the study, Dr. Mark Griffiths, commented on the findings, saying that "pramipexole is a known trigger for pathological gambling and clinicians should be aware of this potential side-effect when prescribing the drug."

Pathological gambling is a serious mental disorder that can have devastating consequences for individuals and their families. It is estimated that around 2% of the population suffers from this condition, and it can be very difficult to treat successfully.

If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, please seek professional help as soon as possible. There are many support groups and treatment options available, and with proper treatment most people can overcome this disorder.

#  Could Pramipexole Cause Problem Gambling in Some Users?

According to a study published in the journal Addiction, the Parkinson's medication pramipexole may be linked to problem gambling in some users.

The study followed nearly 2,000 Parkinson's patients for an average of nearly four years. Of those patients, just over 1% developed a problem with gambling during that time period. The authors of the study found that those who were taking pramipexole were twice as likely to develop a problem with gambling as those who were not taking the medication.

Pramipexole is a dopamine agonist, meaning that it mimics the effects of dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is thought to play a role in addiction, and drugs that increase dopamine levels may be more likely to cause addiction-related problems.

The authors of the study say that more research is needed to determine if pramipexole causes problem gambling or whether people who are more likely to develop a problem with gambling are simply more likely to be prescribed pramipexole. They also note that patients should be monitored for signs of problem gambling while taking pramipexole.

If you or someone you know is taking pramipexole and has been experiencing problems with gambling, it is important to seek help. Problem gambling can have serious consequences, both for the individual and for their loved ones. There are many resources available for those who need help dealing with a gambling addiction, including counseling and support groups.

#  Pramipexole May Lead to Increased Risk of Gambling Addiction

Since pramipexole was introduced as a treatment for restless leg syndrome, cases of gambling addiction have been reported. In some cases, patients developed an uncontrollable urge to gamble after taking the drug.

Pramipexole is a dopamine agonist that works by increasing the amount of dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in reward-motivated behavior. It is thought that pramipexole may increase the risk of gambling addiction by stimulating dopaminergic activity in the brain.

Gambling addiction can be a serious problem. It can cause financial and personal problems, and can even lead to suicide. If you or someone you know has developed a gambling addiction after taking pramipexole, it is important to seek help. There are many treatments available for gambling addiction, including therapy and medication.
