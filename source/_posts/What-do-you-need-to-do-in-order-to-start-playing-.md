#  What should you do if you hit the bonus symbols?

The bonus symbols on a slot machine can be very rewarding, but what should you do if you hit them? Keep reading to find out.

First and foremost, it’s important to know that the bonus symbols don’t always mean you’re going to win a bonus. Sometimes they just act as a multiplier for your winnings. However, if you do get the bonus, there are a few things you need to do in order to make the most of it.

The first step is to read the rules that come with the bonus. They may tell you how much time you have to claim the bonus or what kinds of games you can play with it. If there are any restrictions, make sure you abide by them or you could lose your bonus altogether.

After reading the rules, it’s important to decide what game or games you want to play with your bonus. Not all bonuses can be used on all games, so make sure the game or games you choose are eligible for your bonus. If there are multiple bonuses available, take some time to figure out which one will give you the best return on your investment.

Finally, once you’ve chosen a game and read the rules, it’s time to start playing! Make sure you take advantage of your bonus and try to win as much money as possible with it. Just be careful not to spend too much time on one game – after all, the goal is to walk away with more money than when you started!

# What is the jackpot amount?

The jackpot amount is the top prize that can be won in a lottery game. It is usually the most coveted prize in a lottery and can make someone very wealthy if they are lucky enough to win it.

# How much does the jackpot amount vary?

The jackpot amount varies depending on the lottery game that is being played. Some games have smaller jackpots while others have larger ones. The size of the jackpot also depends on how many people are playing the game and how many tickets have been sold.

# What are some of the largest jackpots in history?

Some of the largest jackpots in history include the $656 million Mega Millions prize from March 30, 2012, and the $590.5 million Powerball prize from May 18, 2013. These are just a few examples; there have been many other large jackpots over the years.

#  What other symbols appear on the reels?

In addition to the traditional symbols that are often found on the reels of slot machines, there are also a few additional symbols that can appear from time to time. These symbols can be helpful in increasing your chances of winning, and it is important to be aware of them when you are playing.

One such symbol is the wild card. This can take the place of any other symbol in order to help you create a winning combination. If you see this symbol on your screen, it's definitely worth your time to keep spinning the reels in hopes of hitting another winning combination.

Another helpful symbol is the scatter. This one doesn't necessarily have to appear on a pay line in order to count towards your winnings; instead, it will payout based on how many appear anywhere on the screen. This can add up quickly if you manage to get several scatters in a row.

Finally, some machines also feature a bonus symbol. This one can vary from machine to machine, but it usually leads to some sort of bonus game or round where you can rack up some extra winnings. Keep an eye out for this symbol if you're looking to maximize your profits while playing slots.
