#  Internet Gambling Spending In UK On The Rise

_ Spending on internet gambling in the UK is on the rise, surpassing £1.7 billion in 2016, according to a new study. The research, carried out by gaming industry watchdog _ _ _ _ and commissioned by the Remote Gambling Association (RGA), also found that the number of people gambling online has more than doubled over the past four years.

The RGA, which represents online and remote gambling operators, said the figures showed there was a "clear appetite" for internet gambling in the UK. It argued that this growing trend highlighted the need for greater regulation of the sector, which is currently overseen by the Gambling Commission.

The study found that Britons spent an average of £474 on internet gambling last year, up from £450 in 2015 and £385 in 2012. It also revealed that 23 percent of people aged 16 or over had gambled online in the past month, up from 11 percent in 2012.

Spending on internet casino games accounted for almost half (£828 million) of all online gambling spending last year, followed by sports betting (£382 million), bingo (£236 million) and poker (£113 million).

Gambling Commission chief executive Neil McArthur said: "These figures reinforce our view that remote gambling is popular and here to stay. They also show why we need to keep a tight grip on it – to ensure consumers are protected from harm."

He added: "We will continue to work with our partners in government and industry to ensure that players are safeguarded from illegal and unlicensed sites, and that they have access to help should they need it."_

#  UK Gambling Companies Report Record Profits

The gambling industry in the United Kingdom is booming, with companies reporting record profits. The industry was worth £13.8 billion in 2016, an increase of 5.4% from the previous year.

The industry is now worth more than the grocery, hotel, and restaurant sectors combined. The growth has been fuelled by a relaxation of gambling laws, which has allowed companies to expand their offerings beyond traditional casino games.

Gambling companies have also benefited from a surge in online gambling, which now accounts for more than half of the market. The biggest player in the online gambling market is William Hill, which reported profits of £259 million in 2016.

Other major players include Ladbrokes Coral Group and GVC Holdings. All three companies have seen their share prices soar in recent years as investors bet on further growth in the sector.

So why is the gambling sector doing so well? There are a number of factors at play. Firstly, there has been a relaxation of gambling laws over the past few years, which has allowed companies to expand their offerings beyond traditional casino games.

Secondly, there has been a surge in online gambling, which now accounts for more than half of the market. This is partly due to the fact that it is easier and faster to gamble online than it is to go to a physical casino. It is also available 24/7, meaning that you can gamble whenever you want.

Thirdly, there has been a big increase in spending by high-rollers. This has helped to offset any slowdown in growth amongst lower-income gamblers. Finally, many people see gambling as a form of entertainment, and are happy to spend money on it.

So will the gambling sector continue to grow? That remains to be seen. However, there are plenty of reasons to believe that it will continue to do well in the years ahead.

#  Internet Betting Accounts For Over A Quarter Of Total Gambling Spend

 A new report has shown that internet betting now accounts for over a quarter of the total gambling spend in the UK. The survey, commissioned by the Gambling Commission, shows that online betting now accounts for £4.7bn in spending - up from £2.9bn in 2013.

The rise in online betting reflects a wider trend towards gambling via digital devices, with the commission reporting that 56% of Brits now gambled digitally in some way in the past year. This was up from 48% in 2013 and accounted for £10.8bn in overall spending - more than half of all gambling expenditure in the UK.

Digital gambling is particularly popular among younger people, with 73% of 16-24 year olds saying they had gambled digitally in the past year, compared to just 38% of those aged 55 or over. However, despite its increased popularity, online betting still accounts for a minority of overall gambling spend - just 28%. Land-based casino gaming still dominates at 43%, while lotteries account for 11% of spending.

The news will come as a blow to anti-gambling campaigners, who have long argued that internet betting represents a greater risk to problem gamblers than other forms of gambling. The commission's report shows that there were 2m problem gamblers in the UK as of last year, costing the economy £1.5bn annually.

#  Online Gambling Now Worth More Than £1 Billion Annually In The UK

Online gambling is now worth more than £1 billion annually in the UK, new figures show.

The data, released by the Gambling Commission, shows that online gamblers in Britain wagered a total of £1.04 billion in 2017, up from £898 million the previous year.

The growth of online gambling is being driven by an increase in the number of people using betting apps and websites, with around two-thirds of British adults now estimated to have gambled online at some point.

Gambling Commission executive director Neil McArthur said the figures showed “the continuing popularity of remote gambling”.

“We are seeing a shift from land-based casinos and betting shops to people playing casino games and betting on sport through their phones and PCs,” he said.

The commission also released figures showing that gross gambling yield – the amount of money generated by gambling operators before costs such as taxes and prizes are paid out – increased by 5% to £2.7 billion in 2017.

This was due to an increase in both the number of bets placed and the amount staked per bet.

While bookmakers have enjoyed a prosperous year, the growth in online gambling has been bad news for casinos, which have seen their share of the market decline from 42% to 36%.

#  Britons Spent Over £13 Billion On Gambling In 2017

British gambling spending is on the rise. A recent study by the Gambling Commission found that Britons spent over £13 billion on gambling in 2017 – up from £11.6 billion in 2016.

The largest chunk of this money was spent on gaming machines, with casino and betting shops also accounting for a significant proportion of spending.

Critics have accused the government of failing to address the social harms associated with gambling, pointing to the fact that around 2 million people are considered to be problem gamblers.

The government has responded to these criticisms by promising to invest £60 million into tackling problem gambling over the next three years. This will include funding for research into the effects of gambling and support services for those affected by problem gambling.

The Gambling Commission has also pledged to improve its regulation of gambling, with a particular focus on protecting children and vulnerable adults from harm.
