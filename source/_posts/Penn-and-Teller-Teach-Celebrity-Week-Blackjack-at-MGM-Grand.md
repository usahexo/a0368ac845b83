#  Celebrity Week: Mark Twain's Favorite Game is Blackjack

This week we're taking a look back at the life of one of America's favorite authors and humorists, Mark Twain. Twain was a fan of blackjack and is said to have even invented his own variation of the game.

Despite being a prolific author, Twain's true love was gambling. He often frequented casinos in Nevada, playing games like blackjack and roulette. One of his favorite pastimes was inventing new rules for blackjack that made the game more favorable to the player.

One such rule allowed players to split any two cards, including Aces. This gave players more chances to win, and increased the house edge by only a tiny fraction. Twain also liked to bet on black or red at roulette, rather than betting on specific numbers. This gave him a better chance of winning, but also increased the risk should the ball land on a black or red slot.

Twain's passion for gambling led to mixed results. He often won large sums of money, but he also lost plenty of times as well. In fact, he once lost so much money at a casino in Carson City that he had to borrow $40 from a friend in order to get home!

Despite his losses, Twain continued to enjoy gambling throughout his life. In fact, his love for blackjack inspired him to write several short stories about the game, which were later published in book form.

If you're interested in learning more about Mark Twain and his favorite game, be sure check out some of his books or articles about blackjack. You'll be sure to get a laugh out of them - after all, Twain was one of the funniest writers of all time!
