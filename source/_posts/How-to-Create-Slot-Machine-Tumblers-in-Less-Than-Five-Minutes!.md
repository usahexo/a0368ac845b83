#  How to Create Slot Machine Tumblers in Less Than Five Minutes!

In this tutorial, we are going to show you how to create a slot machine tumbler in less than five minutes! This is a great project for anyone who wants to learn how to use 3D printing and CAD software.

The first step is to download and install SketchUp. This is a free 3D modeling software that is used by professional designers all over the world.

Once you have SketchUp installed, open it up and create a new file. Next, we are going to create the basic shape of the tumbler. We are going to do this by using the “Rectangle” tool. Draw a rectangle that is 10 inches wide by 6 inches high.

Now, we need to add some features to the tumbler. We are going to do this by using the “Extrude” tool. Select the top face of the rectangle and extrude it 2 inches up. Then, select the front face of the rectangle and extrude it 1 inch out.

Next, we need to add some details to the tumbler. We are going to do this by using the “Circle” tool. Draw two circles that are 2 inches in diameter. Then, draw a smaller circle that is 1 inch in diameter in the center of the larger circles.

Now, we need to add some text labeling to our tumbler. We are going to do this by using the “Text” tool. Type in “SLOT MACHINE TUMBLER” and position it so that it is centered on the tumbler.

Finally, we need to save our file as a .SKP file so that we can print it out on our 3D printer.



#  How to Make a Slot Machine Tumbler in Under 5 Minutes

 Slot machines are one of the most popular casino games in the world. Everyone from seasoned players to those who have never played before enjoy the excitement and anticipation that comes with pulling the lever on a slot machine. Slot machines come in all shapes and sizes, but one thing they all have in common is the tumbler. This component is responsible for rotating the reels and awarding payouts to players when they hit winning combinations.

If you’ve ever been curious about how a slot machine works, or if you want to make your own at home, this article is for you. In under 5 minutes, you can create your own working slot machine tumbler using materials that are readily available online or at your local hardware store. Let’s get started!

What You Will Need:

- A cylindrical container such as a 2-liter plastic bottle
- Cutting tool (e.g., scissors, utility knife)
- Ruler or measuring tape
- marker or Sharpie
- Hot glue gun and glue sticks
- 6 dowel rods (or other cylindrical objects) of varying sizes
- Sandpaper (optional)

The first step is to measure and cut the top off of your cylindrical container. Make sure to leave enough room so that the dowel rods will fit inside snugly. Use a cutting tool to make the cut, and then use sandpaper (optional) to smooth out any rough edges.


Next, take your ruler or measuring tape and mark evenly spaced measurements around the circumference of the container. Make sure to leave enough space at either end so that you can easily grip the container when it is turned on its side. Connect the marks with a line, then use a marker or Sharpie to draw a circle around the perimeter of the top. This will be your guide for cutting out the slots in which the dowel rods will rotate.


Now it’s time to cut out the slots! You can do this easily using a hot glue gun and some glue sticks. Simply hold the container against a flat surface and apply hot glue around the inner circle markings. Quickly insert each dowel rod into its corresponding slot before the glue has a chance to cool off. Make sure that each rod is inserted all the way into its slot so that it is held firmly in place. Allow time for the glue to set before moving on to Step 4.



          Step 4: Assembling The Tumbler Base

  Now it's time to assemble the base of your tumbler. This part is made up of 3 pieces: an axle hub, a motor mount, and a drive wheel. The axle hub will hold everything together while allowing it to spin freely, the motor mount will attach the motor to the axle hub, and the drive wheel will transfer power from the motor to the dowel rods.


Start by drilling 2 holes in opposite sides of your axle hub large enough for screws or bolts to fit through snugly.( If you don't have a drill, you can use a hammer and nails instead.) Next, attach your motor mount to one end of your axle hub using screws or bolts.( If you're not comfortable using tools, you can also find premade motor mounts online or at your local hardware store.) Finally, attach your drive wheel to the other end of your axle hub.(You may need two people for this step.) Make sure that when everything is assembled correctly,the drive wheel spins freely without any resistance.(If there is resistance, adjust one ofthe screws/bolts until it rotates smoothly.)



    Step 5: Putting It All Together

 Now it's time screw/bolt everything together! Start by attaching one end ofthe axle hubto one side ofyour container using screws or bolts.( MAKE SURE THAT THE MOTOR MOUNT IS ON THE SIDE WITH THE SLOTS FOR THE DOWEL RODS!) Next, attachthe other endofthe axle hubto theeother sideofyour containerin exactlythe same way.(Ifyou don't havea second personto helpyou,you can also use clampsinstead.) Thenattach themotor mountto theeither endofthe axle hubusing screwsor bolts.( MAKE SURE THAT IT'SAttached STRAIGHT SO THATTHE MOTOR SPINS FREELY!)

#  Create a Slot Machine Tumbler in Just Minutes

In this tutorial, we're going to create a slot machine tumbler in just minutes using OpenSCAD. This is a great project for beginners as it doesn't require any complicated programming and the results are pretty cool.

First, open up OpenSCAD and create a new file. We're going to start by creating the basic shapes for our tumbler. Start by defining the height and width of your tumbler.

height = 80; width = 20;

Next, we'll define the base of our tumbler. This is a simple square with rounded corners.

cube([width * 1.5, height * 1.5, width], $fn=100); translate([width / 2, height / 2, 0]) circle(r=4);

Now we'll add the sides to our tumbler. These are again simple squares with rounded corners. Note that we're using a variable called $fn to control the number of sides that are drawn on each corner. This gives us a more realistic looking edge.


$fn=100; cube([width * 1.5, height * 1.5, width], $fn=100); translate([width / 2, height / 2, 0]) circle(r=4); cube([width * 1.5, height * 1.5, width], $fn=100); translate([width / 2, height / 2, 0]) circle(r=4); cube([width * 1.5, height * 1.5, width], $fn=100); translate([width / 2, height / 2, 0]) circle(r=4);

Lastly, we'll add the top and bottom pieces to our tumbler. These are again simple cubes with rounded corners but with a smaller size than the rest of the tumbler.


$fn=100; cube([width * .75, height * .75, width], $fn=100); translate([width / 2 + (height / 3),height /2 - (height/3),0]) circle(r=4); cube([width *.75 ,height*.75 , width], $fn=100); translate([width*/2- (height*1/3),Height*1/3 ,0])circle(r = 4) ;
  Now that we have all of our basic shapes defined we can start putting them together to create our slot machine tumbler! The best way to do this is to start with the base and then add on each subsequent shape around it. So let's start by adding the sides to our base:

translate([0,-10,-15]) cube([10,-10,-15]); //Side #1 translate([0,-10,-10]) cube([10,-10,-10]); //Side #2 translate([0,-15,-10]) cube([15,-10,-10]); //Side #3 translate([0,-15,-5]) cube([15,-5,-5]); //Side #4

Next we'll add the top piece:

 translate([0,-15,-20])cube ([ 15*-1.-15*20 , -15*1.-15*20 , 0 ] ); //Top Piece

Lastly we'll add the bottom piece:

 translate ([ 0 , - 20 , - 15 ])cube ([ 20*-1.-20*15 , -20*1.-20*15 , 0 ] ); //Bottom Piece

#  How to Quickly Create a Slot Machine Tumbler

In this tutorial, we will be showing you how to create a slot machine tumbler. This is a great project for anyone who wants to learn more about 3D printing and Arduino. We will be using an Arduino Leonardo, but any Arduino model should work.

We will start by creating the 3D printable files for the tumbler. We recommend using Meshmixer to do this. It is a free software that allows you to easily design and edit 3D prints.

Once you have created the 3D printable files, you can print them on your 3D printer. If you don't have a 3D printer, you can always send them to a service like Shapeways.

Next, we will create the Arduino code for the tumbler. This code will control the stepper motors that rotate the tumbler. You can find the code on our Github page.

 Finally, we will show you how to put it all together. First, insert the stepper motors into the slots in the base of the tumbler. Then, attach the Arduino board and power supply to the back of the tumbler. Finally, connect the stepper motor wires to the Arduino pins.

Now it's time to test it out! Power on the Arduino board and watch as the tumbler spins around!

#  How to Easily Create Slot Machine Tumblers

Slot machines are one of the most popular casino games in the world. Though they may seem complicated at first, with the right tools and instructions, you too can create your very own slot machine tumbler. In this article, we will show you how to make a slot machine tumbler using materials that are easy to find and affordable.

What You Need:

-Plywood (at least 2’x2’)

-Ruler or tape measure

-Circular saw

-High-grit sandpaper (120 or higher)

-Stencils or a template for the circular saw blade (optional)

-Paint or a sealant (optional)

Instructions:

1. Cut the plywood into a square using a circular saw. We recommend making it at least 2’x2’, but you can make it any size you want. If you don’t have a circular saw, ask a friend or family member to help you out.





2. Use high-grit sandpaper to smooth out the edges of the plywood square. You can do this by hand or with a power sander. Be sure to get all the sharp edges so that there is no risk of injury.



  3. Decide on the design for your slot machine tumbler. You can use stencils or a template to make it easier, but it is not necessary. If you are using a template, be sure to measure and mark where each cut should be made before drilling any holes.



 4. Drill two holes in opposite corners of the plywood square using a drill bit that is slightly smaller than the width of your blade screws . These will be used to attach the blade later on.



 5. Attach your blade screws to your circular saw blade and tighten them as much as possible. Be very careful when doing this so that you do not cut yourself!



 6. Align the blade screws with the drilled holes on the plywood and carefully drill them in . Again, be very careful not to cut yourself – take your time and use caution when wielding a power tool! It may help to have someone else hold the plywood square still while you drill in the screws.



 7. Once everything is drilled in place, you can paint or seal your slot machine tumbler however you like . We recommend using a sealant if you plan on using it outside, as paint may chip and fade over time when exposed to sun and rain.
