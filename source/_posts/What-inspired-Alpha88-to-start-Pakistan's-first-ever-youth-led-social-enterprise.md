#  What inspired Alpha88 to start Pakistan's first ever youth-led social enterprise?

Pakistan is a country full of young people with an abundance of untapped potential. Unfortunately, there are not many opportunities available for them to utilize this potential in a constructive way.

Alpha88 was started with the aim of filling this gap. We wanted to create a platform where young Pakistanis could come together to share their ideas and work together to make a difference in their communities.

We believe that young people have the energy and creativity needed to solve some of Pakistan's most pressing issues. We also believe that by working together, we can achieve more than we can individually.

Our mission is to empower youth through education and entrepreneurship, and create positive social change inPakistan. We are committed to providing our members with the resources and support they need to achieve their goals.

We are proud to be Pakistan's first ever youth-led social enterprise, and we will continue to work hard to make a difference in our community. Thank you for your support!

#  What challenges does Alpha88 face in Pakistan?

Alpha88, a leading digital currency and blockchain company is planning to expand its business in Pakistan. However, the company faces several challenges in the country.

The first challenge is that there is a lack of awareness about digital currencies in Pakistan. Most people are not familiar with Bitcoin and other digital currencies. As a result, Alpha88 needs to educate people about the benefits of digital currencies and how they can be used to make payments.

Another challenge is that there is no clear regulatory framework for digital currencies in Pakistan. This makes it difficult for companies like Alpha88 to operate in the country. The government needs to introduce regulations that clarify the role of digital currencies in the economy.

Another challenge is that there is a lack of IT infrastructure in Pakistan. This makes it difficult for companies to set up their operations in the country. Alpha88 will need to invest in IT infrastructure in order to support its business expansion plans.

Despite these challenges, Alpha88 believes that there is great potential for growth in the Pakistani market. The company plans to invest heavily in marketing and education initiatives to promote the use of digital currencies in Pakistan. It also plans to work closely with the government to develop a clear regulatory framework for digital currencies.

#  What advice would you give to other young people who want to start their own social enterprise?

Starting a social enterprise can be a daunting task, but it’s also an incredibly rewarding experience. Here are four pieces of advice that I would give to other young people who are looking to start their own social enterprise:

1. Don’t be afraid to ask for help.

Starting a social enterprise can be a lot of work, and there will undoubtedly be times when you will feel overwhelmed or frustrated. But don’t forget that you are not alone – there are plenty of people who are more than happy to offer help and support. Don’t be afraid to reach out to your network of family, friends, and mentors for advice and guidance.

2. Find your passion.

One of the most important things when starting a social enterprise is finding something that you’re passionate about. You need to be excited about the work that you’re doing, because it will be much harder to stick with it if you’re not interested in what you’re doing. So take some time to figure out what you’re really passionate about and then focus your social enterprise around that.

3. Be patient.

Building a successful social enterprise takes time and patience – Rome wasn’t built in a day, after all! Don’t expect your business to become profitable overnight; instead, give yourself time to grow and develop your idea into something great. Rome wasn’t built in a day, after all! Don’t expect your business to become profitable overnight; instead, give yourself time to grow and develop your idea into something great. 4. Believe in yourself! Finally, remember that success comes from within – so believe in yourself and your ability to make your social enterprise a success! If you have faith in yourself and your vision, then others will too.

#  What are Alpha88's plans for the future?

Alpha88 is a cryptocurrency that aims to revolutionize the online gambling industry. It plans to do this by providing a platform where users can gamble in a secure and transparent environment.

The team behind Alpha88 is working hard to make its vision a reality. They are currently in the process of developing their own blockchain platform, which will be used to power the Alpha88 ecosystem.

This blockchain platform will be based on the Ethereum network and will enable users to gamble using ETH and other ERC20 tokens. It will also feature a built-in decentralized exchange (DEX), so users can easily exchange coins and tokens.

In addition to the blockchain platform, Alpha88 is also working on a mobile app that will allow users to gamble on the go. This app will be available on both Android and iOS devices and will offer a wide range of gambling options, including casino games, sports betting, and lotteries.

The team is also planning to launch an online casino that will accept both fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. This casino will be fully licensed and regulated, so users can rest assured that their funds are safe and secure.

Finally, the team is planning to hold a token sale in order to raise funds for development purposes. The token sale will take place in October 2018 and will offer participants the chance to purchase Alpha88 tokens (A88).
